# Deploy user SSH public and private keys
# In this context, we'll create a new key pair ONLY for deployment. This way, the source VMs, the OS disks, the deployed VM, etc. all only know
# about this SSH user (plus of course we configure the VM admin SSH public key below). This eliminates the risk of credential leak: the SSH user and keys
# are generated here - this could be your dev box, or a build server, or a CI/CD pipeline agent - and are as transient as you want.
# If this is a hosted build agent, this SSH public/private key pair's lifetime is only as long as the build agent's (plus a cleanup script is provided).





# VM Admin SSH public key - we assume we are provided ONLY a public key, not the private key, and that it is generated and managed outside this context.
# We use this to enable a deployed VM to be logged into and used by the user account whose public SSH key this is.
# This SSH key is not used in this context to log into the VM. It's used here to configure the VM for eventual use by this user account.
# It's hard-coded here but of course if this is stored in the Key Vault used elsewhere here, you can just retrieve it from there at this point.
