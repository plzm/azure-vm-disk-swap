# NOTE - for complex situations, it may make more sense to detach data disks from a VM; then swap OS disk; then re-attach data disks.
# Recommend you test through your scenario to determine what works well.

# ALL OF THIS SHOULD BE RUN -->ON<-- THE DESTINATION VM so you should SSH there

# Do this the FIRST TIME the VM comes up - this prepares the data disk filesystems.
# This is NOT needed more than once in the lifetime of a data disk.
# Partition the two data disks for the first time - this is NOT needed each time OS disks are swapped.
# This assumes you left step0.variables.sh/$dataDiskCount=2 - if you changed that, change this accordingly.
# TODO make this and other blocks below loop with step0.variables.sh/$dataDiskCount iterations
